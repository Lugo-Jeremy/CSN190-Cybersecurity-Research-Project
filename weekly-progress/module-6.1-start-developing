What I am doing is researching coding within cybersecurity and the fundamentals of
what makes coding such a powerful skill and tool in the field of Cybersecurity. The problem I am
solving is finding information on new tools and or frameworks to help with security and threat
detection. Whether there are known effective frameworks or even ways to develop new ones for
the potential future of security in the cyber world, that is what I am seeking for my research.
What I plan to deliver at the end of the project is to have a developed research project based on
effective frameworks, whether they are new and upcoming or modern and known in the cyber
world. The research methods I will use to find information are Github, YouTube, Google and
articles as well as forums. The sources I will do my best to analyze are the most used and or most
visited github repositories, YouTube videos with thousands of views or top of the search, Google
as well with articles and forums like Reddit could be of use but Reddit is not the most credited
since they are a lot of mixed opinions on there. I could potentially be steered into misinformation
but it is worth a try. I will try to include any hands-on testing or evaluation with some code
testing of my own with VS code and PyCharm. I plan on reviewing at least 2 of each source, so
potentially 2 github repositories, 2 youtube videos sources, 2 google searches such as articles and
or forums. To even out the amount of info but also not to focus too much on info and have space
for testing and evaluation.
3 Clear Goals
● Ambitious Goal - To accomplish learning frameworks or a framework to attain for future
potential use
● Realistic Goal - Learning coding framework for threat mitigation in the cyber world
● Minimum Goal - Learning code and a coding framework for threat detection and
mitigation
