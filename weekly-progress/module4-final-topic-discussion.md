Final Topic Selection: Coding and Cybersecurity
	The topic I chose as my final topic will be Coding and Cybersecurity. What I will be doing for this project analysis is researching the fundamentals of Linux and Python each in their equal rights to navigate both skills and apply what I learned towards the field of Cybersecurity. This topic is achievable with the amount of resources we have today like Google, Youtube and Github. It is challenging because any new skill to learn is challenging, until you get adjusted to the fundamentals which leaves the door open to dive deeper in learning. It is meaningful to me because it will apply to me in the field I want to be in and stand out with the skills I have. It balances feasibility and growth because you are not meant to be perfect at what you learn or do, being perfect does not leave room to fail and learn even more. My ideal outcome would be to navigate both Linux and Python past a beginner level and apply those skills in the field. I am aiming more to focus on Linux skills first because that is the base foundation in Cybersecurity and coding automations would be a special skill. What I’ll accomplish that demonstrates learning would be the fundamentals and knowing what each function does and understand how it applies to the field. The skills I will develop are the fundamentals and basic functions of Linux and how to apply them, plus the coding language Python and the fundamentals with that and applying those skills towards building automations tools for mitigation. Attempting this is valuable because it teaches me that there is more to this field than meets the eye. There are many things that apply to this field and that give me the impression that I should not put myself in a box and aim for the stars. The sky is the limit.
