The Github project I decided to clone was a repository that is named intro-2-cybersecurity-in-python. What the project essentially is showing through python is many small demo scripts covering both offensive and defensive cybersecurity concepts. Some of the scripts are intentionally malicious (virus, worm, backdoor, keylogger, ransomware). It is essential to read what scripts to run and not run for the safety of your system. The steps I followed were initiated by Copilot. With the help of copilot I was able follow the necessary steps for installation and follow what to run and what not to run. I did not encounter any problems and everything was smoothly installed to run. I learned how to clone repositories into VS Code and how to properly install using copilot. The AI agent helped tremendously with the installation process and I will definitely be using Copilot whenever I am using VS Code for future projects.
