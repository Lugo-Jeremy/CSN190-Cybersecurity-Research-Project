type: Peer Reviewed Journal Article
Synopsis: This study shows the impact, pros and cons, and future of the use of AI. Artificial Intelligence is supposed to be used as a tool towards a decision, but humans are supposed to make the decisions rather than AI making the decision for us. Joseph Weizenbaum, a pioneer of AI, said that we must not let computers make important decisions for us because AI as a machine will never possess human qualities such as compassion and wisdom to morally discern and judge.

citation: AI in Cybersecurity: How AI is Changing Threat Defense. (2025, July 20). ISchool | Syracuse University. https://ischool.syracuse.edu/ai-in-cybersecurity/
type: research report from university
synopsis: This report discusses how AI is part of cybersecurity and helps with machine learning and efficient protection. AI brings intimidation to cybersecurity professionals but it should not be used to solve all issues but rather be used as a tool to get tasks done more faster and accurate. We should not be competing with AI, we should adapt to the changes that AI brings and learn how to use it for our benefit.

type: Research reports from university
synopsis: Given both code generation models’ current utility and the likelihood that their capabilities will continue to improve, it is important to manage their policy and cybersecurity implications. Multiple stakeholders have roles to play in helping to mitigate potential security risks related to AI-generated code. The burden of ensuring that AI-generated code outputs are secure should not rest solely on individual users, but also on AI developers, organizations producing code at scale, and those who can improve security at large, such as policymaking bodies or industry leaders.
link: https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/cybersecurity-risks-of-ai-generated-code/
relevance: 3/5 - There is inadequate transparency around models’ training data—or understanding of their internal workings—to explore questions such as whether better performing models produce more insecure code.

citation: Coding for Cybersecurity. (n.d.). Cybersecurity Guide. https://cybersecurityguide.org/resources/coding-for-cybersecurity/ 
synopsis: Cybersecurity is not simply knowing about potential vulnerabilities and how to correct them. It is much more than that. A successful cybersecurity practitioner will need to learn to think like a hacker. Intimate knowledge of the hacker’s programming tools will enable a defender to anticipate the overall strategy and the employed tactics of the attacker.

type: Webinar from cybersecurity professionals
synopsis: Coding is an essential skill across almost every technological discipline today, and cybersecurity is no exception. Cybersecurity professionals must understand coding concepts to correctly interpret the activity of malicious actors on their networks, and they must be able to write code to perform their own work more efficiently and effectively.
