Cybersecurity has dealt with many breaches in the field from 2013-2014 Yahoo data breach affecting over 3 billion accounts, the 2017 WannaCry and NotPeya ransomware attacks, and the Equifax data breach compromising 147 million people’s info. We’re now in a modern age where technology has evolved and so have threats. Coding in cybersecurity is now a powerful tool for threat detection and threat mitigation. What is needed in the field are more efficient automation solutions to tackle more data breach threats. What is missing are roles that are designed for coding to implement solutions for threat mitigation. I will accomplish discovering automation solutions that are not as popular and bring them more to light as well as discovering newer automation tools for mitigation. My main research question is “Is it possible to develop more tools for threat mitigation?” The methods that I will use to investigate are Google searches for valuable sources. I will also use YouTube for valuable videos sources of professionals in the field. I will lastly look into Github projects for threat detection and mitigation automation tools for sources as well. The outcome I expect is to be knowledgeable in the field of Cybersecurity when it comes to automation and threat detection. I expect to find as many tools as I can find, and if there are not many, how can we as a community in Cybersecurity develop more tools.
